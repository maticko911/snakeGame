This Snake game, written in Python, uses object-oriented programming to create a modular, easy-to-understand code structure. 
The main gameplay logic resides in main.py, where the game loop, event handling, and overall flow are managed. 
The snake.py file defines the Snake class, responsible for creating the snake and handling its movement in four directions: left, right, up, and down. 
The food.py file manages the food object, which appears randomly on the screen for the snake to consume. 
Finally, scoreboard.py is dedicated to tracking and displaying the playerâ€™s score as the game progresses. 
This design approach keeps each component distinct and reusable, making the game code organized and extensible. 
Ideal for those learning Python and OOP, this project showcases fundamental game development concepts in an engaging way.
